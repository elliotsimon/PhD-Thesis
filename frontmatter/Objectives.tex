\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore and document potential applications of minute-scale forecasts for wind energy
    \item Interface with forecast users and providers to determine design criteria
    \item Perform field experiments to obtain observational data needed to build and evaluate remote sensing based forecast models
    \item Implement and test novel forecast methods using lidar observations which adhere to the constraints of real-time usage
    \item Benchmark the lidar forecast method's skill to other commonly used methods
    \item Reflect on the potential benefits and drawbacks of a real-world fulfillment of such a system
\end{itemize}
