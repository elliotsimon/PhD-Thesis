\chapter{Thesis outline and list of publications}
\label{sec:outline}


This thesis consists of an introductory synopsis providing context for the work undertaken, a collaborative review paper of the state of the art in the field and two results papers which form the basis for the novel discoveries made during the PhD project. The papers are connected by various supporting chapters, addendums and case studies. In the end, a discussion and outlook chapter reflects on the key findings and recommends a practical approach for future work in the field. Following this, overall conclusions of the thesis are reiterated.
