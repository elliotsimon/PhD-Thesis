\label{sec:preface}


This PhD thesis was prepared over a three year period at the Ris{\o} campus of the Department of Wind Energy at the Technical University of Denmark partially in fulfillment of the requirements for granting a PhD degree. Funding was provided through a departmental fellowship grant. An academic exchange to the {\'E}cole Polytechnique F{\'e}d{\'e}rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in physics and energy systems took place in 2017. An external stay hosted in the Research Applications Laboratory (RAL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado was conducted in 2018, focusing on artificial intelligence and computer vision methods.
