The health effects of air pollution have been subject to intense study in recent years. Exposure to pollutants such as airborne participate matter and ozone has been associated with increases in mortality and hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. These effects have been found in short-term studies, which relate day-to-day variations in air pollution and health, and long-term studies, which have followed cohorts of exposed individuals over time. Effects have been seen at very low levels of exposure, and it is unclear whether a threshold concentration exists for particulate matter and ozone below which no effects on health are likely. In this review, we discuss the evidence for adverse effects on health of selected air pollutants.},

	abstract = {Doppler LiDARs have become flexible and versatile remote sensing devices for wind energy applications. The possibility to measure radial wind speed components contemporaneously at multiple distances is an advantage with respect to meteorological masts. However, these measurements must be filtered due to the measurement geometry, hard targets and atmospheric conditions. To ensure a maximum data availability while producing low measurement errors, we introduce a dynamic data filter approach that conditionally decouples the dependency of data availability with increasing range. The new filter approach is based on the assumption of self-similarity, that has not been used so far for LiDAR data filtering. We tested the accuracy of the dynamic data filter approach together with other commonly used filter approaches, from research and industry applications. This has been done with data from a long-range pulsed LiDAR installed at the offshore wind farm ‘alpha ventus’. There, an ultrasonic anemometer located approximately 2.8 km from the LiDAR was used as reference. The analysis of around 1.5 weeks of data shows, that the error of mean radial velocity can be minimised for wake and free stream conditions.},

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.},

While the empirical PI from combined forecasts do not provide significant gains, the QRA-based PI are found to be more accurate than those of the best individual model—the smoothed nonparametric autoregressive model.},

In lieu of in situ profile measurements, it is suggested that a power law exponent of 1/7 is adequate for realistic but conservative estimates of the available wind power except at extremely rough sites where the estimates may only be conservative.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for real-time estimation of the possible power of an offshore wind power plant when it is down-regulated. The main purpose of the method is to provide an industrially applicable estimate of the possible (or reserve) power. The method also yields a real-time power curve, which can be used for operation monitoring and wind farm control. Currently, there is no verified approach regarding estimation of possible power at wind farm scale. The key challenge in possible power estimation at wind farm level is to correct the reduction in wake losses, which occurs due to the down-regulation. Therefore, firstly, the 1-second wind speeds at the upstream turbines are estimated, since they are not affected by the reduced wake. Then they are introduced into the wake model, adjusted for the same time resolution, to correct the wake losses. To mitigate the uncertainties due to dynamic changes within the large offshore wind farms, the algorithm is updated at every turbine downstream, considering the local axial and lateral turbulence effects. The PossPOW algorithm uses only 1-Hz turbine data as inputs and provides possible power output. The algorithm is trained and validated in Thanet and Horns Rev-I offshore wind farms under nominal operation, where the turbines are following the optimum power curve. The results indicate that the PossPOW algorithm performs well; in the Horns Rev-I wind farm, the strict power system requirements are met more than 70\% of the time over the 24-hour data set on which the algorithm was evaluated.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a wind plant modeling and optimization tool that enables the maximization of wind plant annual energy production (AEP) using yaw-based wake steering control and layout changes. The tool is an extension of a wake engineering model describing the steady-state effects of yaw on wake velocity profiles and power productions of wind turbines in a wind plant. To make predictions of a wind plant's AEP, necessary extensions of the original wake model include coupling it with a detailed rotor model and a control policy for turbine blade pitch and rotor speed. This enables the prediction of power production with wake effects throughout a range of wind speeds. We use the tool to perform an example optimization study on a wind plant based on the Princess Amalia Wind Park. In this case study, combined optimization of layout and wake steering control increases AEP by 5\%. The power gains from wake steering control are highest for region 1.5 inflow wind speeds, and they continue to be present to some extent for the above-rated inflow wind speeds. The results show that layout optimization and wake steering are complementary because significant AEP improvements can be achieved with wake steering in a wind plant layout that is already optimized to reduce wake losses.

This is carried out by taking into account the interaction between the turbines through wake effects. The optimization scheme is designed in such a way that it yields fast convergence so that it can adapt to changing wind conditions quickly. The scheme has a distributed architecture in which each wind turbine adapts its control settings through gradient-based optimization, using information that it receives from neighbouring turbines. The novel control method is tested in a simulation of the Princess Amalia Wind Park. It is shown that the distributed gradient-based approach performs the optimization in a more time-efficient manner compared with an existing data-driven wind farm power optimization method that uses a game theoretic approach.

The wind information is obtained by a detailed simulation of a LIDAR system. The controller design is evaluated and tested in a simulation environment with coherent gusts and a set of turbulent wind fields using a detailed aeroelastic model of the wind turbine over the full operation region. Results show promising load reduction up to 50\% for extreme gusts and 30\% for lifetime fatigue loads without negative impact on overall energy production.

	abstract = {The penetration of offshore wind power is continuously increasing in the Northern European grids. To assure safety in the operation of the power system, wind power plants are required to provide ancillary services, including reserve power attained through down-regulating the wind farm from its maximum possible power. Currently, there is neither a standardised regulation by the TSOs nor a verified approach regarding the wind farm scale available power estimation. Here we describe an industrially applicable, validated method for the real-time estimation of the possible power of an offshore wind power plant. The developed procedure, the PossPOW algorithm, can also be used in the wind farm control as it yields a real-time wind farm power curve. The modern wind turbines have a possible power signal at the turbine level and the current state of the art is to aggregate those signals to achieve the wind farm scale production capacity. However thesummation of these individual signals is simply an over-estimation for the wind power plant, due to reduced wake losses during curtailment. The determination of the possible power with the PossPOW algorithm works as follows: firstly the second-wise upstream wind speed is estimated, since it is not affected by any wake. Then the upstream wind is introduced into the wake model, adjusted for the same time resolution, to simulate the power losses that would occur duringnominal operation. The PossPOW algorithm uses only 1 Hz turbine data as inputs, namely power, pitch angle, and rotational speed. The method is validated in Horns Rev-I, Lillgrund and Thanet offshore wind farms, together with NREL 5MW simulations. The reduced wake is replaced by the wake model which estimates the velocity deficit for nominal operation. An evaluation of the existing wake models show that the suitable models are tuned for 10-min averaged data. Therefore, the Larsen wake model is re-calibrated for real-time using Thanet data, validated in Horns Rev-I and then implemented in farm scale considering the local turbulence, time delay and meandering. The validation of the algorithm is performed using experiments in Horns Rev-I where two of the upstream turbines are curtailed. The PossPOW algorithm is compared to the current practice and shown to perform significantly better, according to the error scores stipulated in the Danish grid code.},

The wind power forecast error distribution assumed can have a large impact on the confidence intervals produced in wind power forecasting. In this work we examine the shape of the persistence model error distribution for ten different wind plants in the ERCOT system over multiple timescales. Comparisons are made between the experimental distribution shape and that of the normal distribution. The shape of the distribution is found to change significantly with the length of the forecasting timescale. The Cauchy distribution is proposed as a model distribution for the forecast errors and model parameters are fitted.

In this study, a novel hybrid approach is proposed for multi-step-ahead wind speed forecasting utilizing optimal feature selection and an artificial neural network optimized by a modified bat algorithm with cognition strategy. The proposed hybrid model can largely remedy the deficiencies of neural networks for multi-step-ahead forecasting, which is validated for different forecasting horizons, and is shown to work effectively. Finally, experiments based on three verification units from the city of Penglai in China are conducted effectively, illustrating that the proposed model not only has advantages when compared with benchmark models, but also has great potential for application to wind power system.},

The study is conducted with an aggregated wind power plant model which is integrated into a generic power system model, specifically designed to assess the targeted ancillary services in a relatively simple, but still relevant environment. Various case studies with different wind power penetration levels are considered. The study shows that WPPs can provide additional control features such as TFR and POD to enhance the stability of power systems with large share of wind power. Nevertheless, the results illustrate that the power system stability can be potentially degraded without careful coordination between WPPs, simultaneously providing TFR or POD in power systems with large displacement of conventional power plants by WPPs.

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe increasing wind power penetration in power systems represents a techno-economic challenge for power producers and system operators. Because of the variability and uncertainty of wind power, system operators require new solutions to increase the controllability of wind farm output. On the other hand, producers that include wind farms in their portfolio need to find new ways to boost their profits in electricity markets. This can be done by optimizing the combination of wind farms and storage so as to make larger profits when selling power (trading) and reduce penalties from imbalances in the operation. The present work describes a new integrated approach for analysing wind-storage solutions that make use of probabilistic forecasts and optimization techniques to aid decision making on operating such systems. The approach includes a set of three complementary functions suitable for use in current systems. A real-life system is studied, comprising two wind farms and a large hydro station with pumping capacity. Economic profits and better operational features can be obtained from the proposed cooperation between the wind farms and storage. The revenues are function of the type of hydro storage used and the market characteristics, and several options are compared in this study. The results show that the use of a storage device can lead to a significant increase in revenue, up to 11\% (2010 data, Iberian market). Also, the coordinated action improves the operational features of the integrated system. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Accurate wind power forecasts highly contribute to the integration of wind power into power systems. The focus of the present study is on large-scale offshore wind farms and the complexity of generating accurate probabilistic forecasts of wind power fluctuations at time-scales of a few minutes. Such complexity is addressed from three perspectives: (i) the modeling of a nonlinear and non-stationary stochastic process; (ii) the practical implementation of the model we proposed; (iii) the gap between working on synthetic data and real world observations. At time-scales of a few minutes, offshore fluctuations are characterized by highly volatile dynamics which are difficult to capture and predict. Due to the lack of adequate on-site meteorological observations to relate these dynamics to meteorological phenomena, we propose a general model formulation based on a statistical approach and historical wind power measurements only. We introduce an advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method to account for the different features observed in an empirical time series of wind power: autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and regime-switching. The model we propose is an extension of Markov-Switching Autoregressive (MSAR) models with Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) errors in each regime to cope with the heteroscedasticity. Then, we analyze the predictive power of our model on a one-step ahead exercise of time series sampled over 10 min intervals. Its performances are compared to state-of-the-art models and highlight the interest of including a GARCH specification for density forecasts.},

	abstract = {Long range scanning lidars have the ability to be deployed along the coastline to measure the near shore wind resource. Within the wind energy scope, this is most applicable to assessing the potential energy production (and thus revenue) of a prospected near shore wind farm (here defined as 3-12km from the coast). Ground based remote sensing has numerous advantages over traditional in-situ (offshore met mast) and buoy based installations, mainly in terms or cost, complexity, and failure/delay risk. Sinceeach lidar can only measure a portion of the wind vector, it is necessary to either deploy two devices in tandem (dual Doppler) or employ a single Doppler scanning strategy such as PPI (plan position indicator, or sector scan) which allows for estimation of the two component horizontal wind vector. In preparation for a six month long measurement campaign along the Danish North Sea, a one week experiment was performed at DTU’s test centre for large wind turbines (Høvsøre), which lies 1.8km inland and consists offlat terrain with predominate winds from offshore. Two lidars in staring dual Doppler mode and one lidar performing 60 degree sector scans had their beams collocated atop a 116.5m met-mast, which provided reference wind speed and direction values. The 10 minute reconstructed lidar measurements were in excellent agreement with the reference instrumentation. The dual Doppler results matched within 0.1\% of the reference wind speed, with very low levels of unbiased scatter. Sector scan results also indicate very good agreement with the met-mast, corresponding within 0.2\% for wind speed, with an R2 of 0.998. The sector scan results for wind speed exhibit larger amounts of scatter than with dual Doppler, however the bias is centred around the regression line which gives good indication that wind measurements taken using the sector scan method are valid and acceptable for use in performing wind resource studies in simple terrain and in offshore conditions. Further, we show that when measuring in these cases, a sector size of 38 degrees still measures within 0.6\% of the reference data for wind speed.},

The RUNE experiment aims to use lidar measurements and mesoscale modelling to study the behaviour of the flow in the coastal zone and find the most effective way to estimate the near-shore wind resource. In this report we document all information regarding the measurement systems and the coastal campaign.The wind speed is estimated from radial velocities measured by a lidar in sector-scanning mode, from two lidars performing dual-overlapping scans and from five vertical profiling lidars, of which one was operating offshore on a floating platform. All these instruments are inter compared, showing generally good agreement. The availability is best for the vertically profiling lidars, followed by the sector-scan setup, the dual setup and the lidar buoy. We have also reference measurements from the meteorological mast at Høvsøre some kilometers south of the campaign’s site.The wind climate during the campaign is characterized by strong westerlies with occasional storms. The measurements from the vertically profiling lidars agree well with those from the meteorological mast and show a decrease of mean wind speed from west to east. Two lidars (a long- and a short-range system) measuring next to each other measured similar winds speeds, although the wind speed from the long-range lidar had a small positive bias. There was also a positive bias in the mean wind speed from the sector-scan at large measuring distances. Satellite winds from ASCAT, Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X were available. ASCAT were of coarse resolution and were not used for any direct comparisons with the lidar measurements. A spatial average of these SAR wind speeds along the coast was compared with coinciding scanning lidar 10 min wind speeds.TerraSAR-X retrieved winds showed a rather large deviation from the lidar wind speed transects extrapolated to 10 m. Sensitivity tests performed on the methods for the wind speed retrieval showed small differences in the statistics for the different combinations of the spatial resolution and the polarisation ratio. For the cases investigated, the wind direction from the model was not differing by more than 15o compared to the dual setup, but the spatial variability was not captured.},

A novel method was tested for the first time to investigate wake properties with ground-based lidars over a wide range of wind directions. For this method, the three lidars, which were space- and time-synchronized using the WindScanner software, were programmed to measure with crossing beams at individual points up to 10 rotor diameters downstream of the wind turbine. Every half hour, the measurement points were adapted to the current wind direction to obtain a high availability of wake measurements in changing wind conditions. The linearly independent radial velocities where the lidar beams intersect allow the calculation of the wind vector at those points. Two approaches to estimating the prevailing wind direction were tested throughout the campaign. In the first approach, velocity azimuth display (VAD) scans of one of the lidars were used to calculate a 5{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}min average of wind speed and wind direction every half hour, whereas later in the experiment 5{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}min averages of sonic anemometer measurements of a meteorological mast close to the wind turbine became available in real time and were used for the scanning adjustment. Results of wind speed deficit measurements are presented for two measurement days with varying northwesterly winds, and it is evaluated how well the lidar beam intersection points match the actual wake location. The new method allowed wake measurements to be obtained over the whole measurement period, whereas a static scanning setup would only have captured short periods of wake occurrences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This dataset has been recorded by eight long-range WindScanners that were deployed during the Perdigão 2017 campaign. For the campaign which took place in central Portugal near the village of Perdigão eight scanners were located on two mountain ridges that run in parallel for about 2 km. The scanners carried out three synchronized scanning scenarios: transect scans at three positions perpendicular to the ridge with two scanners at two transects and one transect with four scanners; a scan following transects 80m above the ridges; and virtual mast scans at four locations.This is an original dataset. It represents Level 2.3 data product in the FAIR lidar data schematics, that is geo-located radial velocities stored in NetCDF files with dimensions of time, range and line-of-sight number.Consult a list of references for more details about :(1) WindScanner (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8110896)(2) Perdigão site and prequel experiment from 2015 (https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-3463-2017)(3) FAIR lidar data standard (http://e-windlidar.windenergy.dtu.dk/documents/report.pdf)Consult link in Related publications which holds information on the paper that presents a part of the Perdigão-2017 dataset.},

	abstract = {Fiber lasers are becoming new effective sources for coherent lidars, thanks to their spatial and spectral qualities. Allowing operation in continuous, modulated and pulsed modes, their increasing power at eyesafe wavelengths is well suited to anemometry, velocimetry, vibrometry or laser imagery. Requested laser qualities are discussed, concerning wavelength, power, pulse duration and frequency, beam shape and spectral width, and compared to existing fiber source parameters.
